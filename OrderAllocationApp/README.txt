1. I've decided to use a Maven project so that I could easily import dependencies, like Junit, Gson, etc.  You don't need to have Apache maven installed to run it.
2. To run from command line:
  a. install apache maven. https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
  b. navigate into parent folder and type: mvn clean install.
3. To import project into Eclipse. File -> import -> maven projects.
